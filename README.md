 The Rampage of Jeff McCluckerson - Endless Runner Style Game
 
 Adding your own tiles:\
 (1) Find a path asset that you would like to use and drag it to the heirarchy window.\
 (2) For this asset, change its position in the inspector to be x:0, y:0, z:0.\
 (3) In the scene view, note how many grid boxes the path tile takes up in the Z direction.  You may need to position the asset again in order to count the gridboxes.\
     **IMPORTANT - the length (in Z direction) of each tile must be exactly the same, but the width can be any size.**\
     -In the Polygon Farm asset pack, there is a dirt path asset.  If we use these as a base for all of our tiles in this level, then    this is a step we do not have to worry about.\
 (4) Create a new Empty Game Object and name it according to what it will do.  Its position MUST be x:0, y:0, z:0.\
 (5) Drag the path tile onto the Empty Game Object.\
 (6) Now you can move the path tile within this Empty Game Object.  Make sure x and y on the path both remain 0 and that the Empty Game Object remains at x:0, y:0, z:0 or else this will not work.\
 (7) Line up each path with Jeff's feet, use the SampleTiles in the Prefab/Tiles folder as a guide.  Each tile MUST be the exact same length for this to work.\
 (8) Any objects/obstacles added to the path MUST be added as a child to the path itself NOT the Empty Game Object. (Refer to SampleTile3 in Prefabs/Tiles folder).  Make sure to tag any objects that you want Jeff to die on as "Enemy". DO NOT tag the entire path or Empty Game Object, just tag the individual obstacles.\
 (9) When you are finished, drag the Empty Game Object to the Prefab/Tiles folder to save it as a prefab.\
 (10) Click on the TileManager object in the heirarchy view.  Under its script, there should be a dropdown for an array called "Tile Prefabs".  Change its size based on how many prefabs you have created.  Drag and drop each prefab from the Prefabs/Tiles folder onto each element of this array.\
    **IMPORTANT - make sure that there is a tile prefab without any obstacles on it.  Place this tile on "Element 0" in the array.  This way Jeff won't initially spawn into obstacles.**\
   \
   A Note on Eggs:\
   (1) When adding an egg to a scene, make sure its y position is set above at least 0.5 so that the float mechanic works correctly.\
   (2) After the egg has been added, copy the collectSound object from SampleTile2 and place it as a child of the empty game object for the tile you're making.\
   (3) Drag the collectSound object onto the empty slot for the EggBounce script.\
   (4) Only ONE collectSound object needs to be on a tile.  Each egg must have this collectSound object added to it.
